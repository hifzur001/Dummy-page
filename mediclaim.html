                        Gender, Relationship, etc., they have to make sure that the data
                        is relevant and valid and thereafter submit the details to the
                        insurer. The employee's data must reach the insurer within 30 days
                        of their joining. Employees also have to inform HR whenever they
                        need to get a new dependant added to their policies, like in case
                        of marriage, birth, or adoption of a child. All this information
                        has to be submitted to the insurer within 30 days of the process.
